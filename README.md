# Password-Generator
Hey this is J0ey, this program is a very basic password generator where you can choose the number of letters, numbers, and special characters in a number. In order to use this program, you will need to have Python installed.

You can check if you have it by going to the terminal and entering
```python --version```, ```python```, or ```py```
If not you can download Python on Linux: 
                                        ```sudo apt install python```
                                        You can change the packet manager in the line above, if you don't use "apt".
For Windows you can visit the Python website below:
                                                   https://www.python.org/downloads
                                                   Choose your windows version and follow instructions from there.
To download the code from Linux enter ```git clone https://github.com/J0eyhacksgibsons/Password-Generator.git```
For Windows: you can copy it or save it as a zip from the top right of the code.

To run the code in the command line while in the same directory ```python password_generator.py```
It should work from there.
